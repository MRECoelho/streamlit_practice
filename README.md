This repo is a practice environment to get familiar with the Python [Streamlit library](https://www.streamlit.io/).

The apps are mostly based on tutorials but are modified by me as a more in-depth learning process.

Todo:
- Stock price
    - Get company info with/from tickerSymbol
    - Add multiple companies and let user have a drop down to choose from
    - Dynamic time range
- Crypto currency price
    - Set Euro as default currency (investigate scraping data)
    - Nice table format (maybe w/ Seaborn?)
    -
