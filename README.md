This repo is a practice environment to get familiar with the Python [Streamlit library](https://www.streamlit.io/).

The apps are mostly based on tutorials but are modified by me as a more in-depth learning process.

Todo:
- Stock price (from [Data Profoessor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q))
    - Get company info with/from tickerSymbol
    - Add multiple companies and let user have a drop down to choose from
    - Dynamic time range
- Crypto currency price (from [Data Profoessor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q))
    - Set Euro as default currency (investigate scraping data)
    - Nice table format (maybe w/ Seaborn?)
    -
- Birdwatch integration
    - Finish & publish birdwatch (duh)
    - Fun info graphics using streamlit --> brainstorm for options
